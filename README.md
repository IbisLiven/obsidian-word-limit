# Word Limit
An Obsidian plugin to help you write smaller notes, mirroring what would have been possible with physical zettlekasten systems. It will provide a soft limit when you go over your word count.

## Limit type
You have the option to limit by characters or lines instead of words.
**currently word counts are inaccurate, character and line counts are more reliable**

## Flexible limits
You can set you own limits (within reason) to use instead of the default 200 words.

## Future features
Several features are planned but not yet implemented. This includes:
1. more accurate counts
2. add option to only count body text
3. remembering your settings for previously used limit types (not just the current one)
4. providing an setting to override the limit slider (not reccomended)
5. option to impose hard limits (preventing you from typing more after you reach your limit)
